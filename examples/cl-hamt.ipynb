    "This notebook demonstrates how to use the Common Lisp library `cl-hamt`.\n",
    "`cl-hamt` provides data structures for sets and dictionaries based on [hash array-mapped tries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_array_mapped_trie) (HAMTs).\n",
    "This data type provides insertion, deletion, and lookup of entries in a collection of size $n$ in $\\log_{32}(n)$ time.\n",
    "The space usage is asymptotic to $n\\cdot\\log_{32}(n)$ + some constant overhead.\n",
    "For large collections, this overhead is a small fraction of the whole, but if you're working with a large number of small-size collections, a list or an association list might be more appropriate.\n",
    "The dictionary data type in the [Clojure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clojure) programming language's standard library is implemented using HAMTs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of HAMTs in this library is fully persistent.\n",
    "A persistent collection is never truly modified; rather, when one wishes to add an entry to a collection, a new collection is returned which contains the new element and the old, unmodified collection is preserved.\n",
    "The new augmented collection, however, shares as much structure as possible with the old collection.\n",
    "The garbage collector cleans up any old versions of data structures for us if we're not using them anymore.\n",
    "All told, these persistent collections don't use much more memory than their imperative counterparts.\n",
    "Since persistent collections are fundamentally immutable and one never makes destructive updates, they can be much easier to reason about and debug."
